Overview
------------

A VR project built by a team of 5, because we thought VR was fun. We were right. 

Project allowed our team to practice SCRUM management, in addition to teamwork on an actual project. 



Installation
------------

    Download VRrobocopter.apk and install it on your android phone

All other files included allow the user to open the project in Unity. Sprint planning, burnout charts, and additional data was included to demonstrate how our team practiced and used SCRUM to complete the alpha version.
